# Pixel-based Sand Simulation
Simple particle physics simulation inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8) written in Rust.

I am using [pixels](https://crates.io/crates/pixels) for rendering.

Set framerate limit using args. Default is vsync.

### Controls
`lmb` to draw selected pixel type.

`rmb` to delete pixels.

`1` - `6` to select pixel type.

`scroll` to change cursor size.

### Example
